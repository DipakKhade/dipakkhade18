## what is hydration error:
the term "hydration error" typically refers to issues related to the hydration process during server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG). Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and making client-side updates to a page that was initially rendered on the server.

## solution :
You can make a page dynamic so that according to rqquirment the page can render on server as well as on client side

make this changes in your functional component 
```
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
```

```
export default dynamic (() => Promise.resolve(Navbar), {ssr: false})
```
