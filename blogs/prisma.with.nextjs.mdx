Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to work with databases in your Next.js applications. In this tutorial, we'll go through the steps to integrate Prisma into a Next.js 14 project and perform basic database operations.

## Step 1: Setting up a Next.js 14 Project

First, let's set up a new Next.js 14 project. You can do this using the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@14 my-next-prisma-app
```

Navigate into your project directory:

```
cd my-next-prisma-app
```

## Step 2: Installing Prisma

Next, let's install Prisma as a dependency in our project:

```
npm install @prisma/client prisma
```

## Step 3: Configuring Prisma

Now, let's configure Prisma for our project. We'll use the Prisma CLI to initialize a new Prisma project:

```
npx prisma init
```

Follow the prompts to select your database and set up your Prisma schema.

## Step 4: Connecting Prisma to Next.js

In order to use Prisma in our Next.js application, we need to establish a connection to our database. We'll do this in a separate file called 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Prisma into your Next.js 14 project. Now you can perform database operations easily using Prisma's powerful features.

Happy coding!
